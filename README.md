## Hot-Corners for windows!
its a bit like what gnome has because thats what inspired it, you can set the .exe to run on startup

there are alternatives but i couldnt get them to work

if you are going to edit this and then compile it yourself you should compilte it with : 'gcc -o hot-corners hot-corners.c -mwindows'
